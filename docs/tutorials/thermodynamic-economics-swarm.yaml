# foundations for the Univrs.io ecosystem
#
# Phases:
#   Phase 1: Acknowledge & Learn

name: thermodynamic-economics-initiative
version: "0.1.0"
description: |
  Comprehensive learning and development initiative to address fundamental
  thermodynamic gaps identified by Dr. Louis Arnoux's critique of Mycelial Economics.
  
  Core questions we must answer:
  - Where does the energy come from and how does it flow?
  - What is the EROEI of our proposed systems?
  - Does the Hyphal Network topology have proper small-world properties?
  - Can our system achieve autopoietic closure?
