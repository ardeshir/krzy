## The Luddite Question

In 1811, textile workers in Nottinghamshire began smashing the stocking frames that were eliminating their livelihoods. History has turned "Luddite" into an insult—a synonym for technophobe.

This is a lie.

The Luddites weren't opposed to technology. They were opposed to the *deployment* of technology in ways that enriched factory owners while immiserating workers. They asked a question Silicon Valley has worked hard to suppress:

**Who benefits from this machine?**

## The Critic's Mirror

This site exists as the shadow of [Univrs.io](https://univrs.io)—every technical milestone questioned, every claim examined, every assumption challenged.

The builder and the critic are the same person. The split is for clarity.

If I stop being able to write these critiques, I've become the Winged Lion—projecting peace while building tyranny.

## Influences

- **Brian Merchant** — *Blood in the Machine*: The true history of the Luddites
- **Karen Hao** — *Empire of AI*: Critical tech journalism, following power
- **The original Luddites** — The question that won't die
